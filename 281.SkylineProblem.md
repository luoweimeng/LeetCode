## Problem setting

A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).

 Buildings  Skyline Contour
The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.

For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .

The output is a list of "key points" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.

For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].

## Solution

扫描线算法

把大楼左边标为红色(+)，右边标为绿色(-)。用一个tuple存储该数据结构，height(pos, +/- index)

维护一个priority queue，存储楼的高度。如果遇到红线，则将该楼的高度入队，否则将该楼的高度出队。维护当前最高高度current，每次遇到新的线，进行入队或出队后，比较current和队顶元素的大小，如果不相等，则加入result；如果队为空，说明新的高度为0。

```java
class Solution {
    public List<int[]> getSkyline(int[][] buildings) {
        ArrayList<int[]> heights = new ArrayList<>();
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        //maximum heap
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b)->(b - a));
        for (int i = 0; i < buildings.length; i++) {
            //(left, num) (right, -num)
            heights.add(new int[] {buildings[i][0], i + 1});
            heights.add(new int[] {buildings[i][1], -(i + 1)});
        }
        
        Collections.sort(heights, (a, b) -> (a[0] - b[0]));
        
        int current = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.size(); i++) {
            int position = heights.get(i)[0];
            int index = heights.get(i)[1];
            if (index > 0)
                pq.offer(buildings[index - 1][2]);
            else
                pq.remove(buildings[-index - 1][2]);
            
            //如果当前线的位置与后一个一样，跳过更新高度操作
            if (i < heights.size() - 1 && heights.get(i)[0] == heights.get(i+1)[0])
                continue;
            //扫描线。There is no building, set current height = 0
            if (pq.isEmpty() && current != 0) {
                result.add(new int[] {position, 0});
                current = 0;
                //目前building最高
            } else if (pq.peek() != current) {
                result.add(new int[] {position, pq.peek()});
                current = pq.peek();
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
