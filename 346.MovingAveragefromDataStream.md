## Problem setting

Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

```
For example,
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
```


## Solution
We should keep the most recent numbers, which should follow a FIFO behavior. It's naturally a queue.

```java
class MovingAverage {
    private Queue<Integer> q;
    private int s;
    private int sum;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        q = new LinkedList<>();
        s = size;
        sum = 0;
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        if (q.size() == s) {
            int t = q.poll();
            sum -= t;
        }
        q.offer(val);
        sum += val;
        return sum / (double) q.size();
    }
}

/**
 * Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MovingAverage obj = new MovingAverage(size);
 * double param_1 = obj.next(val);
 */
```
