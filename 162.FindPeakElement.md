## Problem setting
A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array where num[i] ≠ num[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -∞.

For example, in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
## Approach 1

It's very natural to come up with the idea. Simply compare the ith element with i-1 and i+1. Remember to deal with the case i = 0 and i = n-1 

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
            if ((i == 0 || nums[i-1] < nums[i]) && (i == nums.length-1 || nums[i] > nums[i+1]))
                return i;
        return nums.length - 1;
    }
}
```

## Approach 1.1

Then we find that we don't need to compare i with i-1. The first element satisfy nums[i] > nums[i+1] must be the peak element.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++)
            if (nums[i] > nums[i+1])
                return i;
        return nums.length - 1;
    }
}
```
## Approach 2

The above two solutions are all linear time complexity. Could we do it in O(logn)? We can use binary search!Like solutions before, we simply compare nums[n] with nums[n+1], then prune the search space according to the comparision.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.length - 1;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid+1])
                high = mid;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }
}
```
